# About


Sambal bridges the divide between statically generated website and server rendered website.  Write once and decide later how you want to deploy it.  Sambal is also not opinionated about which UI library you use as long as it can be bundled into a web component.  Other exciting features offered by Sambal:

1. Renders HTML using Javascript literal template

2. Renders schema.org json-ld metadata 

3. Supports json-ld data format

4. CSS in JS

5. Automatic Javascript bundling using Webpack
