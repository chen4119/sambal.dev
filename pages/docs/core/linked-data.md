# Everything is schema.org json-ld

In Sambal, every piece of data is assumed to be schema.org json-ld.  This means you can reference another piece of data stored locally in the pages or data folder or remotely using absolute url.  For example

```markdown
---
"@type": BlogPosting
headline: My first blog post
author:
  "@id": author/johnsmith
image:
  "@id": https://example.com/2021/media/image-1.webp
---
My first blog post!
```

Note that @id is a special keyword defined in the json-ld spec to reference another piece of data.  Here the author of the blogpost is stored as a local file with the relative path author/johnsmith.  No need to specify file extension.  @type is another special keyword to set the type of the data. Sambal automatically adds @context and @id to your data so if the blogpost markdown above is created under pages/2021/first-blog.md, the data will be loaded as

```json
{
    "@context": {
        "@vocab": "https://schema.org",
        "@base": "https://example.com"
    },
    "@id": "/2021/first-blog",
    "@type": "BlogPosting",
    "headline": "My first blog post",
    "author": {
        "@id": "author/johnsmith"
    },
    "image": {
        "@id": "https://example.com/2021/media/image-1.webp"
    },
    "text": "My first blog post!",
    "encodingFormat": "text/markdown"
}
```

The @id of the data is the relative path of the file from the root pages or data folder.  The @base is the base url specified by the user.

# Image files are schema.org json-ld too

Sambal support automatically generating ImageObject json-ld for jpeg, gif, webp, png image files.  For the image referenced above, Sambal will fetch `https://example.com/2021/media/image-1.webp` and convert that to the following

```json
{
    "@id": "https://example.com/2021/media/image-1.webp",
    "@type": "ImageObject",
    "contentUrl": "https://example.com/2021/media/image-1.webp",
    "encodingFormat": "image/webp",
    "width": "&lt;actual width of image&gt;",
    "height": "&lt;actual height of image&gt;"
}
```

# What if you are unfamiliar with schema.org?

While Sambal assume every data will be using schema.org vocabulary, it doesn't do any validation internally.  This means that you can still use plain old json with your own schema, for example

```markdown
---
title: My first blog post
author:
  name: John Smith
tags: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
---
My first blog post!
```

The downside is that you will not be able to use existing Sambal themes that expect schema.org format and that the json-ld files generated by Sambal will not validate with Google structured data testing tool.
