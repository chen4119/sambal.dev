# Another static site generator?

There are a lot of static site generators out there.  Jekyll, Hugo, GatsbyJS are just a few of the more popular ones.  Why should you choose to use Sambal?  You might be asking yourself that question now.  Allow me to re-introduce you to a static site generator.

Traditionally, the main job of a static site generator is to transform your PROPRIETARY data into HTML.  Emphasis on proprietary because chances are only you or your organization understand your data.  You might not even think that's a problem.  Why should you care if a stranger doesn't understand your data?  But here's the thing.  The vast majority of content created are not unique.  Just think about how many static site generators you've already used before reading this and you'll understand how content and ideas will eventually converge.  That's why the big search engines like Google, Microsoft and Yandex created schema.org to standardize some of the most frequently seen content on the web. But how does that benefit you as a content creator?  Here are two big reasons.

1) Use schema.org metadata to improve search ranking with Google and Microsoft
2) Increase your discoverability.  Eyeballs are not your only audience.  Recommendation engine and bots of every kind crawl the web for data.

Now back to how Sambal differs from the other static site generators in the market.  The goal of Sambal is to transform your proprietary data into HTML and semantic metadata.  It natively supports json-ld format, schema.org vocabulary and provide a seamless way to simultaneouly transform your data into HTML and schema.org json-ld.  This way, your HTML and metadata are always consistent with each other.

Otherwise, Sambal is un-opinionated about your directory structure, where your data resides (i.e. REST, GraphQL or locally), or what UI library you want to use, if any, as long as you can compile it into a HTML5 custom element.  We take pride in introducing as little proprietary things as possible.
