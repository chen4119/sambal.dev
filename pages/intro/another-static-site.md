Someone will ask this question so that’s why this is in the Introduction.  Yes, there are a lot of static site generators out there.  Jekyll, Hugo, GatsbyJS, VuePress, just to name a few popular ones but each one is essentially just a different way of constructing and manipulating a HTML document.  GatsbyJS and VuePress have the added benefit of PWA features which make your site speedier.

Sambal is not about inventing a new way to make an HTML document.  We opt for well known, standard way of creating HTML such as Javascript template literal for templating and use your favorite UI library (React, Vue, LitElement, etc.) for web components.  We take pride in introducing as little new things as possible.  

Sambal is essentially a static site generator that transforms your schema.org jsonld data into a HTML document. Schema.org’s comprehensive vocabulary for structured data is founded by Google, Microsoft and other big search engines.  Rather than creating your own schema for your site and pigeonholing yourself in a secluded data island, why not leverage a community driven set of schemas to increase the SEO of your site and have more control on how your site is linked with the vast amount of other data on the internet? 

At the end of the day, websites are radically more useful when they are appropriately linked to the right data.  It’s how your audience discover you, it’s how your audience make sense of your content.  Increasingly, structured data is more important than the plain old HTML document.  It’s time webmasters treat their data schemas as first class citizens and HTML documents as simply a side effect of your data.  Not the other way around.
